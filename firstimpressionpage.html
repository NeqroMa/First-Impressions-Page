Whenever we meet someone for the first time, whenever we interview someone for a
job, whenever we react to a new idea, whenever we’re faced with making a decision
quickly and under stress, we use that second part of our brain. How long, for example,
did it take you, when you were in college, to decide how good a teacher your
professor was? A class? Two classes? A semester? The psychologist Nalini Ambady
once gave students three ten-second videotapes of a teacher—with the sound turned
off—and found they had no difficulty at all coming up with a rating of the teacher’s
effectiveness. Then Ambady cut the clips back to five seconds, and the ratings were
the same. They were remarkably consistent even when she showed the students just
two seconds of videotape. Then Ambady compared those snap judgments of teacher
effectiveness with evaluations of those same professors made by their students
after a full semester of classes, and she found that they were also essentially
the same. A person watching a silent two-second video clip of a teacher he or
she has never met will reach conclusions about how good that teacher is that are
very similar to those of a student who has sat in the teacher’s class for an
ntire semester. That’s the power of our adaptive unconscious.

      <h1>2nd section on Doctors</h1>
      <p style="color: black; font-size:140%; padding: 10px; margin: 10px">
        Doctors

        Listening to Doctors Let’s take the concept of thin-slicing one step further. Imagine you work for an insurance company that sells doctors medical malpractice protection. Your boss asks you to figure out for accounting reasons who, among all the physicians covered by the company, is most likely to be sued. Once again, you are given two choices. The first is to examine the physicians’ training and credentials and then analyze their records to see how many errors they’ve made over the past few years. The other option is to listen in on very brief snippets of conversation between each doctor and his or her patients.

        By now you are expecting me to say the second option is the best one. You’re right, and here’s why. Believe it or not, the risk of being sued for malpractice has very little to do with how many mistakes a doctor makes. Analyses of malpractice lawsuits show that there are highly skilled doctors who get sued a lot and doctors who make lots of mistakes and never get sued. At the same time, the overwhelming number of people who suffer an injury due to the negligence of a doctor never file a malpractice suit at all. In other words, patients don’t file lawsuits because they’ve been harmed by shoddy medical care. Patients file lawsuits because they’ve been harmed by shoddy medical care and something else happens to them.

        What is that something else? It’s how they were treated, on a personal level, by their doctor. What comes up again and again in malpractice cases is that patients say they were rushed or ignored or treated poorly. “People just don’t sue doctors they like,” is how Alice Burkin, a leading medical malpractice lawyer, puts it. “In all the years I’ve been in this business, I’ve never had a potential client walk in and say, ‘I really like this doctor, and I feel terrible about doing it, but I want to sue him.’ We’ve had people come in saying they want to sue some specialist, and we’ll say, ‘We don’t think that doctor was negligent. We think it’s your primary care doctor who was at fault.’ And the client will say, ‘I don’t care what she did. I love her, and I’m not suing her.’”

        Burkin once had a client who had a breast tumor that wasn’t spotted until it had metastasized, and she wanted to sue her internist for the delayed diagnosis. In fact, it was her radiologist who was potentially at fault. But the client was adamant. She wanted to sue the internist. “In our first meeting, she told me she hated this doctor because she never took the time to talk to her and never asked about her other symptoms,” Burkin said. “‘She never looked at me as a whole person,’ the patient told us....When a patient has a bad medical result, the doctor has to take the time to explain what happened, and to answer the patient’s questions—to treat him like a human being. The doctors who don’t are the ones who get sued.” It isn’t necessary, then, to know much about how a surgeon operates in order to know his likelihood of being sued. What you need to understand is the relationship between that doctor and his patients.

        Recently the medical researcher Wendy Levinson recorded hundreds of conversations between a group of physicians and their patients. Roughly half of the doctors had never been sued. The other half had been sued at least twice, and Levinson found that just on the basis of those conversations, she could find clear differences between the two groups. The surgeons who had never been sued spent more than three minutes longer with each patient than those who had been sued did (18.3 minutes versus 15 minutes). They were more likely to make “orienting” comments, such as “First I’ll examine you, and then we will talk the problem over” or “I will leave time for your questions”—which help patients get a sense of what the visit is supposed to accomplish and when they ought to ask questions. They were more likely to engage in active listening, saying such things as “Go on, tell me more about that,” and they were far more likely to laugh and be funny during the visit. Interestingly, there was no difference in the amount or quality of information they gave their patients; they didn’t provide more details about medication or the patient’s condition. The difference was entirely in how they talked to their patients.

        It’s possible, in fact, to take this analysis even further. The psychologist Nalini Ambady listened to Levinson’s tapes, zeroing in on the conversations that had been recorded between just surgeons and their patients. For each surgeon, she picked two patient conversations. Then, from each conversation, she selected two ten-second clips of the doctor talking, so her slice was a total of forty seconds. Finally, she “content-filtered” the slices, which means she removed the high-frequency sounds from speech that enable us to recognize individual words. What’s left after content-filtering is a kind of garble that preserves intonation, pitch, and rhythm but erases content. Using that slice—and that slice alone—Ambady did a Gottman-style analysis. She had judges rate the slices of garble for such qualities as warmth, hostility, dominance, and anxiousness, and she found that by using only those ratings, she could predict which surgeons got sued and which ones didn’t.

        Ambady says that she and her colleagues were “totally stunned by the results,” and it’s not hard to understand why. The judges knew nothing about the skill level of the surgeons. They didn’t know how experienced they were, what kind of training they had, or what kind of procedures they tended to do. They didn’t even know what the doctors were saying to their patients. All they were using for their prediction was their analysis of the surgeon’s tone of voice. In fact, it was even more basic than that: if the surgeon’s voice was judged to sound dominant, the surgeon tended to be in the sued group. If the voice sounded less dominant and more concerned, the surgeon tended to be in the non-sued group. Could there be a thinner slice? Malpractice sounds like one of those infinitely complicated and multidimensional problems. But in the end it comes down to a matter of respect, and the simplest way that respect is communicated is through tone of voice, and the most corrosive tone of voice that a doctor can assume is a dominant tone. Did Ambady need to sample the entire history of a patient and doctor to pick up on that tone? No, because a medical consultation is a lot like one of Gottman’s conflict discussions or a student’s dorm room. It’s one of those situations where the signature comes through loud and clear.

        Next time you meet a doctor, and you sit down in his office and he starts to talk, if you have the sense that he isn’t listening to you, that he’s talking down to you, and that he isn’t treating you with respect, listen to that feeling. You have thin-sliced him and found him wanting.

  <h1> The New-Boy Network by Malcolm Gladwell</h1>
<p style="color: black; font-size:120%; padding: 10px; margin: 10px">
Nolan Myers grew up in Houston,
the elder of two boys in a middleclass family.He went to Houston’s High
School for the Performing and Visual
Arts and then Harvard, where he intended to major in History and Science.
After discovering the joys of writing
code, though, he switched to computer
science. “Programming is one of those
things you get involved in, and you just
can’t stop until you finish,” Myers says.
“You get involved in it, and all of a sudden you look at your watch and it’s four
in the morning! I love the elegance of it.”
Myers is short and slightly stocky and
has pale-blue eyes. He smiles easily, and
when he speaks he moves his hands
and torso for emphasis. He plays in a
klezmer band called the Charvard Chai
Notes. He talks to his parents a lot. He
gets B’s and B-pluses.
This spring, in the last stretch of his
senior year, Myers spent a lot of time
interviewing for jobs with technology
companies. He talked to a company
named Trilogy, down in Texas, but he
didn’t think he would fit in.“One of Trilogy’s subsidiaries put ads out in the paper
saying that they were looking for the top
tech students, and that they’d give them
two hundred thousand dollars and a
BMW,” Myers said, shaking his head in
disbelief. In another of his interviews, a
recruiter asked him to solve a programming problem, and he made a stupid
mistake and the recruiter pushed the answer back across the table to him, saying
that his “solution”accomplished nothing.
As he remembers the moment, Myers
blushes. “I was so nervous. I thought,
Hmm, that sucks!” The way he says
that, though, makes it hard to believe
that he really was nervous, or maybe
what Nolan Myers calls nervous the
rest of us call a tiny flutter in the stomach. Myers doesn’t seem like the sort
to get flustered. He’s the kind of person you would call the night before the
big test in seventh grade, when nothing
made sense and you had begun to panic
